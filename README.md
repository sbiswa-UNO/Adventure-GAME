This project features a playable character with movement, attack, and animations. This demo also includes a coin system that features a displayed counter. The project also features a datastore that currently only saves and retrieves coins. The coins also infinitely spawn at random locations above 300 pixels on the y axis if there are less than 20 coins in the world. The demo also features a sword slash projectile for the attack. The projectiles disspear when touching the window left/right borderes.
